 * The stub domain: an item with a name and a count. Replace it with yours — this file, the entity
 * that keeps it, the endpoint that exposes it and the view that lists it are the whole shape of a
 * ankka service, and they are all in this project.
 *
 * Plain data, no I/O. The entity below decides what changes it; this file only says how a change
 * is applied — which is what makes both testable without a runtime.
