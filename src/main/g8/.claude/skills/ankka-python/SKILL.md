description: Write, run, test or deploy an ankka service in Python — components as classes with component_id, codecs and decorators (@command, @query, @step, @action, @get, @stream), the SDK's effects and testkits, the sidecar that hosts the process, the gRPC protocol and discovery, the shared JSON encoding with Scala, and the descriptor fields and environment split of a process-hosted service. Use when the task involves Python, the ankka Python SDK, the sidecar, uv or pytest in an ankka project, or a service in a language other than Scala.

# ankka in Python

A Python service runs as its own process with the ankka runtime beside it as a sidecar. The sidecar owns
everything durable and distributed (sharding, the journal, projections, timers, the workflow engine, the
agent loop and the model's key, HTTP binding and ACLs, cluster membership); the process owns the
decisions: which events for this command, what a step does, an agent's plan and tools. The SDK speaks the
gRPC protocol so your code never does. Every component guide in the other ankka skills applies; this
skill holds what differs.

## Rules

1. **Every component is a class with a `component_id` and codecs.** `state_codec = json_codec(State,
   "manifest")`, `event_codec = json_codec(Event, "manifest")`, `row_codec`, `out_codec`. Handlers are
   `@command("wire-name")`, `@query("wire-name")` (must return a read-only effect; registration refuses
   otherwise, and the sidecar refuses events from one regardless), `@step("name")`, `@action("name")`,
   `@get("/{id}")` and friends, `@stream`. Register classes on `Ankka.service().register(Cls)`.
2. **Field names are the stored JSON.** Dataclass fields use the stored spelling (`productId`), not
   snake case, so one journal is readable from Scala and Python. Sum types are unions of frozen
   dataclasses with the case's simple name as `"type"`. A `str`, `int` or `bool` argument or reply
   crosses the wire as plain text under manifests `string`, `int`, `boolean`, so an endpoint returning
   `str` answers `text/plain`, a test calling `.json()` on it fails with "Expecting value", and a `str`
   body is posted raw.
3. **Effects mirror Scala's in snake case.** `self.effects.persist(e).then_reply(lambda _: DONE)`,
   `.then_reply_state()`, `.delete_entity()`, `.expire_after(timedelta)`, `self.effects.error(msg,
   ErrorCode.CONFLICT)`; `update_state`, `update_row`/`delete_row`/`ignore`, `produce`/`done`/`ignore`,
   `self.step_effects.update_state(s).then_transition_to("charge", input)`, `then_pause(after=...,
   on_timeout=StepRef("step"))`, `then_end()`, `then_fail()`. `self.state`, `self.row`, `self.entity_id`,
   `self.metadata.subject`.
4. **Calls are awaited and addressed by id and wire name.** `await client.for_event_sourced_entity(
   "shopping-cart", "c1").call("add-item").invoke(item, reply=Done)`; `for_key_value_entity`,
   `for_workflow`, `for_agent(...).call(name).stream(input)`, `views.get(view_id, key, Row)`,
   `views.all(view_id, Row)`, `timers.schedule(timer_id, delay, component_id, name, input)`,
   `timers.cancel`. A refusal raises `ankka.client.CommandError` with `error.code`. The client comes as a
   constructor argument in an endpoint, `self.context.client` in a step, `self.client` elsewhere.
5. **Pass the request's metadata on.** In an endpoint, `self.client.with_metadata(self.request.metadata)`
   makes the handler's calls children of the request's trace. `self.request` has `query_param`,
   `query_params`, `header`, `principal`; raise `HttpProblem(status, message)` for a status. The process
   never binds an HTTP port; `acl` defaults to `Acl.ALLOW_ALL`, so set it; `Acl.AUTHENTICATED` answers
   503 for now.
6. **Steps and agents run in the sidecar's engines.** A step may be `async`; the sidecar journals its
   transition. Workflow settings the engine enforces (timeouts, `Recovery(max_retries, failover_to)`)
   are declared on the class so discovery can carry them. An agent's `tools` and `guardrails` are class
   attributes named in the effect; `memory(False)` for one-shot; `with_model("anthropic" | "scripted")`;
   the model is configured on the sidecar through `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANKKA_MODEL_NAME` or
   `ANKKA_MODEL_SCRIPT` in the descriptor's `env`, and the process never sees the key.
7. **Views in Python answer `get` and `all` only.** SQL conditions over rows are a Scala service's.
   `ViewTestKit`, `ConsumerTestKit`, `WorkflowTestKit`, `TimedActionTestKit`, `EventSourcedTestKit` and
   `KeyValueTestKit` run one component with no sidecar; the integration testkit runs the real sidecar
   (Docker; on Linux it needs `host.docker.internal` mapped, which the testkit sets).
8. **Discovery reports every problem at once.** The sidecar asks the process what it hosts, validates it
   all, and logs every problem in its own log and back to the process; read the whole list and fix in
   one restart. It waits 60 seconds for discovery. Ports: the process listens on 9010, the sidecar on
   9011, both loopback.
9. **Deploy as a process-hosted service.** The descriptor sets `hosting: "process"` and the protocol
   version the SDK speaks; the image holds only your process; the platform adds the sidecar at the
   platform's version. Environment is split by name: `ANTHROPIC_*`, `ANKKA_MODEL_*` and `ANKKA_DB_*` go to
   the sidecar, everything else to the process. A topic-sourced view or producing consumer needs
   `ANKKA_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` or the sidecar refuses to start, naming the component.
10. **The process holds no durable state.** It may crash or restart freely; the sidecar re-opens entities
    when it returns and callers retry a brief `Unavailable`. Do not cache state in the process across
    commands.

## Development loop

`uv sync`, `uv run pytest -q`, `uv run mypy`; `uv run conformance` runs the behaviour suite the SDK must
pass. Install with `pip` from the official `python` image in a Dockerfile rather than a `ghcr.io` base.
See `references/get-started/first-service-python.md` for the first service and
`references/reference/python-sdk.md` for the map of every class, attribute and decorator.

## Mistakes to check for

- Snake-case field names on a type that shares a journal with Scala.
- A `@query` that returns a persisting effect; a producing consumer with `produces_to` and no `out_codec`.
- A test parsing a `str` reply as JSON, or posting a `str` body as a JSON string.
- Calls from an endpoint without `with_metadata`, leaving orphan traces.
- Reading a session id inside a tool function instead of in the handler's plan.

## Reference files

Open the one a task needs; each is one topic and stands alone.

### Get started

- `references/get-started/first-service-python.md` — Write a Python service with an event sourced entity and an HTTP endpoint, run it beside the ankka sidecar, test it with and without the sidecar, and watch it in the local console.

### Concepts

- `references/concepts/polyglot.md` — How ankka hosts a service written in Python or TypeScript — the runtime runs beside the process as a sidecar, owning everything durable and distributed, while the process decides what each command does.

### Build

- `references/build/serialization.md` — How ankka encodes state, events, arguments and messages as JSON under a named manifest, what the JSON looks like in both languages, and how to change a stored type without breaking a journal.
- `references/build/testing.md` — Test ankka components at two levels in Scala and Python — unit test kits that run a component with nothing else, and integration test kits that run the whole service against a real database — with scripted models for agents.

### Run and deploy

- `references/deploy/deploy-a-service.md` — Write a service descriptor, apply it with the ankka CLI, and follow the service from UpdateInProgress to Ready, including environment variables, secrets, version declarations and Python services.

### Reference

- `references/reference/python-sdk.md` — A compact map of the Python SDK — installing it, and for every component kind its base class, class attributes, decorators, effect builders and testkit — plus the SDK's own development commands.
- `references/reference/sidecar-protocol.md` — The gRPC protocol between the ankka sidecar and a service's process — transport, the discovery handshake, every service and RPC, the payload encoding, versioning, and the rules the messages do not state on their own.
