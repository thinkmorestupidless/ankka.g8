# ankka agents

An agent's handler describes one interaction as an effect (instructions, the message, tools, guardrails,
which memory, which model) and returns it. The runtime runs the loop: calls the model, runs the tools it
asks for, feeds results back until it answers, applies guardrails, writes the session and counts tokens.
An agent is addressed by a **session id**, one request per session at a time. In Python the loop runs in
the sidecar, which calls back into the process only to run a tool or a guardrail.

## Rules

1. **Decide whether an agent is right before writing one.** A decision that needs a model is an agent; a
   fixed sequence is a workflow whose steps call agents; a rule about one thing is an entity the agent's
   tool calls. An agent handler cannot pause, wait for a person, or run for hours. Work through
   `references/concepts/designing-agents.md` for a new agent.
2. **`withContext` for anything retrieved, `userMessage` for what the user said.** Memory records the
   user's turn only, so retrieved documents and entity state do not fill the next turn's history. An
   agent reads what it needs through `componentClient` itself rather than being handed it.
3. **Tools are declared, small and well described.** `FunctionTool.named("get_forecast")
   .describedAs(...).param[String]("destination", "...").handle { ... }`: up to three typed parameters,
   each described; the description is the interface the model chooses by. Prefer tools that read (a view,
   an entity query). A writing tool calls an entity command so the entity's rules apply, is named as an
   action, and is safe to call twice. A failing tool is an answer: the exception's message goes to the
   model, so make it actionable and never let it leak internals.
4. **Tools run after the handler returns.** Read the session id or anything from context in the handler
   and capture it in the closure; reading it inside the tool throws.
5. **Pick the memory deliberately.** `MemoryProvider.limitedWindow` (the default) reads and writes the
   whole session; `.none` for one-shot routing or classification that must not pollute a conversation;
   `.readLast(n)`, `.readOnly`, `.writeOnly`, `.filtered(MemoryFilter.includeFromAgentId(role))` to
   narrow; `.withInterceptor` to redact before writing. Every stored message carries the agent's `role`.
6. **Session ids are global to the service and name the memory.** One per chat, or one per workflow
   instance when agents collaborate; prefix by purpose (`support:user-1`) unless sharing is intended. A
   busy session queues up to 32 requests and then refuses with `Unavailable`; a stream on a busy session
   is refused at once. Independent conversations get independent ids.
7. **Guardrails see only the user message and the final answer**, not context, tool arguments or tool
   results. Input guardrails run before any model call and cost nothing; output guardrails run before
   memory is written, and on a stream *after* the text was sent. A rejection fails with `Forbidden`
   naming the guardrail; a model refusal also fails with `Forbidden`. Cheap checks first; they stop at the
   first rejection.
8. **Structured replies are asked for in the prompt.** `thenReplyAs[T]` decodes the model's JSON with a
   `JsonValueCodec[T]` declared at the top level of the file (the agent class cannot see its companion's
   givens); the schema is not sent, so describe it in the system message. The reply type also needs a
   `Serializer` because it crosses the wire to the caller. A reply that does not decode fails naming `T`.
9. **Register the runtime pieces.** `AgentRuntime.withDefaultModel(AnthropicProvider.fromEnv(), timeout)`
   plus `AgentRuntime.descriptors` (the session memory entity); with compaction, `agents.descriptors` and
   a `ProjectionRuntime`, because the compactor is a consumer over session events. Streaming handlers are
   registered with `stream`, not `command`, and consumed with `.stream(...)`.
10. **Model choice is per interaction.** `effects.model(provider)` overrides the service default in that
    handler; there is no per-agent default. `effort` is the lever on Claude models, not temperature. The
    model timeout (two minutes by default) applies to each round trip, so bound the whole with
    `maxToolCallSteps` (100 by default; lower it for short tasks). A caller's `invoke` waits only the
    10-second ask timeout: await agent calls with an explicit, longer timeout and match the step timeout.
11. **The loop does not retry, and cost is counted, not capped.** A failed model call fails the request
    and writes nothing; retry from a workflow step or the caller. Tokens accumulate on the session
    (`forSessionMemory(id)` → `history`); there is no budget or circuit breaker, so a spend limit is a
    tool or entity of your own. A reply cut short at `maxTokens` returns as a normal reply.
12. **Coordinate several agents from a workflow** when it costs money or takes minutes: sequential steps,
    `invokeAsync` fan-out, a memory-less selector for dynamic routing whose output the workflow
    validates, all on the workflow's id as the session, a summariser filtered to the specialists' roles.
    A person in the loop is an agent that proposes (`thenReplyAs`) and a workflow that pauses and applies
    on a command.

## Streaming

`thenStream()` on a handler registered with `stream`; the client gets a `Source[String, NotUsed]`, and
`sse(template)` / `sseBody` serve it as `text/event-stream` with every `data` field a JSON-encoded
string (raw text loses a leading space and splits on newlines). Every turn streams, including text before
a tool call. Read query parameters and headers while building the `Source`, not inside it. A refusal ends
the stream with a `CommandError`.

## Python differences

Tools and guardrails are class attributes named in the effect (`tools("forecast")`); `memory(False)` is
the memory-less case; `with_model(name)` chooses among the sidecar's configured models only
(`anthropic`, `scripted`); `then_reply_json()` decodes by the handler's reply type; compaction is not yet
configurable. The model is configured on the sidecar through the descriptor's `env`: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`ANKKA_MODEL_NAME`, or `ANKKA_MODEL_SCRIPT` for tests. The process never holds the key.

## TypeScript differences

Tools and guardrails are static tables of `tool(name, description, InputShape, run)` and `guardrail(name,
check)`, named in the effect by wire name (`.tools("lookup")`); the tool's input shape is also the JSON
Schema the model sees, and its arguments arrive decoded. Handlers are `command(...)` or `stream(...)` entries
returning `this.effects.systemMessage(...).userMessage(q)....thenReply()`; `thenReplyJson<R>()` types the
JSON reply for the caller; `memory(false)` is the memory-less case; `withModel(name)` chooses among the
sidecar's configured models. A tool runs on a fresh agent instance bound to the session, so `this.sessionId`
and `this.client` are available in it. `AgentTestKit.of(Cls, session, new ScriptedModel().expectToolCall(...)
.expectText(...))` runs the loop in process and fails when the script runs out. The model is configured on
the sidecar as for Python; the process never holds the key.

## Testing

Script the model with `TestModelProvider` (`expectText`, `expectToolCall`, `expectParallelToolCalls`,
`whenUserSays`) and assert on behaviour: which tools ran with what arguments, which agents ran, that they
shared a session, that a refusal reached the caller as `Forbidden`. It fails loudly when the script runs
out. Give the agent and the compactor separate providers, because the compactor is asynchronous and the
two would race for one queue. Drain a workflow before the test ends. Never assert on the model's prose;
keep an evaluation set for the real model outside the build.

## Mistakes to check for

- Concatenating retrieved text into `userMessage` instead of `withContext`.
- A `JsonValueCodec` for `thenReplyAs` declared in the companion, where the class cannot see it.
- Reading `sessionId` inside a tool body; a `Guardrail` whose `val name = name` names itself (null).
- An endpoint calling an agent with the default 10-second `invoke`.
- One `TestModelProvider` shared by an agent and the compactor; a test that leaves a workflow mid-flight.
- A shared session id for unrelated features, or many users on one session.

- `references/build/agents.md` — Write an agent in Scala or Python — instructions, tools, guardrails, session memory, structured replies and compaction — and configure the model it talks to.
- `references/build/streaming.md` — Stream an agent's reply token by token to a caller and over HTTP as server-sent events, and know what streaming changes about guardrails and sessions.
- `references/build/multi-agent-orchestration.md` — Coordinate several agents from a workflow — sequentially, in parallel, or chosen dynamically by another agent — sharing one session, and test the coordination with a scripted model.
- `references/build/component-client.md` — Call entities, workflows and agents through the component client — blocking or asynchronous, with typed refusals and timeouts — and query views through the view client.
- `references/build/testing.md` — Test ankka components at two levels in Scala and Python — unit test kits that run a component with nothing else, and integration test kits that run the whole service against a real database — with scripted models for agents.
